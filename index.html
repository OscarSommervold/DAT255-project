# Deep learning and satellite data  

## Introduction  

The satellite industry is undergoing huge growth, fueled by (and leading to) a significant drop in the price to construct and deploy satellites.  
Their usage is regularly expanded to new domains and novel applications, and the importance of methods able to extract actionable insight from data gathered from satellites is ever increasing.    

## Goals  

- Explore how computer vision systems based on deep learning can be used with satellite imaging to attack interesting problems and issues.  
- Motivated by your exploration, perform hands-on experiments using real satellite data.  

## Methods and materials used

- [ForestNet](https://stanfordmlgroup.github.io/projects/forestnet/)  
- Ship or iceberg? [The Statoil challenge](https://www.kaggle.com/c/statoil-iceberg-classifier-challenge)
